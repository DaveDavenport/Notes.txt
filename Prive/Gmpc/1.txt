Keybindings Review
==================

Maybe it is a good idea to make a set of keys for 'song-list',
These bindings will be the same everywhere. 

Section 1:
~~~~~~~~~~

+A-[0-9] Works also for searching between browsers, this is done based on the order specified by the user.
q: Should F1-0 follow same scheme
+<C-Tab> Switch to next browser
+<C-S-Tab> Switch to prev browser.

-TAB key is used by default to switch focus in GUI programs, not good to bind.

Section 2:
~~~~~~~~~~

X should be crop..  (space-X should do what you specified)
+ space  Center and select current song.
- I do not want to implement 'add random'. 
q: How do you envision going left/right in the play queue?
/: This works as a filter.
-?: Does not exists, because search is filter, there is no point.
+Esc: Close filter mode.
+Enter: Activate active row (aka play).

Section 3:
~~~~~~~~~~
-Q: You cannot deque here. Only in play-queue.
-e: Tag editor is deprecated.


Section 4:
~~~~~~~~~~

+Add a keybinding to add all the returned results at once.

Section 5:
~~~~~~~~~~

See previous remarks.

Section 6:
